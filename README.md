# Stable-Diffusion-3.0-Core-Image-generator
Gradio interface for running Stable Diffusion 3.0 or Core via API

1.  Create an account at [stability.ai ](https://platform.stability.ai/) if you don't already have one.
2.  Go to your account
3.  Go to API Keys and create one
4.  Copy the API key
5.  Put all the files in a folder of your choice
6.  Insert your API key in the file "API.txt"
7.  You might need is to install gradio before running the script. Run this command in a command prompt if you need to:
      pip install gradio
8.  Run "run.bat" and that should be it

If you want to run this in a Python virtual environment instead you can create a venv the usual way and then install gradio like above

In the folder where you have put your files

Run python -m venv venv
Run call venv\scripts\activate.bat
Run pip install gradio
Run "run.bat"

That's about all the info you might need I think.

Enjoy :)
